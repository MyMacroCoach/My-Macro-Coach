# Project overview
My name is Jasmine, I am a high school student, and I started this project as a macronutrient tracking app that actively prevents eating disorders though no numbers, and no consequences. 

# Key features 
The app will mainly contain bars that fill up as opposed to a certain calorie number that a user would obsess over, In addition to this there is slight variation in the calories day by day. The app sends notifications when a user is running low of a certain micro/macronutrient and also gives a mini lesson about the importance of said nutrient.
