# Project overview
My name is Jasmine, I am a high school student, and I started this project as a macronutrient tracking app that actively prevents eating disorders though no numbers, and no consequences. 

# Key features 
The app will mainly contain bars that fill up as opposed to a certain calorie number that a user would obsess over, In addition to this there is slight variation in the calories day by day. The app sends notifications when a user is running low of a certain micro/macronutrient and also gives a mini lesson about the importance of said nutrient.

# General features 
- Activity monitor integration
- Large & easy to use food database
- Easy recipe system
- Barcode/nutrition label scanning
- Pre-made recipe suggestions
- Easy grocery list creation, while encouraging eating with what you have
- Logging of the users energy levels
- Info easy to send to healthcare providers & personal trainers
- Plug in system

# Languages
Maybe swift, somewhat TBD as Iâ€™ve mostly been conducting interviews as of now
