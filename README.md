# Project overview
My Macro Coach started as a response to a personal struggle with disordered eating, I was eating 27% of the calories I was supposed to be eating. All enabled by the fact that I was tracking my calories and obssessing over numbers, the apps I was using were benefiting from my struggles with monthly subscriptions.

The goals of My Macro Coach is to provide a free, open-source, and community-driven alternative to the existing apps. Tracking macros should be intuitive, customizable, and most importantnly, healthy, mentally and physically. This is why we are communicating with professionals at every step of the way to ensure that My Macro Coach is the best it can be.

As we grow, we welcome everyone to contribute in any form, whether by offering feedback or suggesting new features in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/r3Nk2dqevu), or collaborating on our GitHub.

Thank you for being part of our journey!
